<h4><b>Digest:</b><br/></h4>
<p >with the perspective of industry, the need of energy increase and new source of energy is developing, like nuclear, wind , water…….however, they are not to meet the enormous need.so our group is contributed to explore how to get the more power by changing blades, rate of gears and manufacture the tower in Wind Turbine form the first week to third week in the first term. The essay will show the result of our experiments according to the information which is suit for students in university.
    This reporter mainly describes the detailed the process of the manufacture WIND TURBINE ,which is the task of group. According to this lab ,we can directly and scientifically recognize the structure of turbine and the relevant power output……<br/></p>
<h2><div style="letter-spacing:10px;">Background theory</div></h2>
<p > To built a electric machine and let it change the  mechanical to the electric power we need to know some theory .Here are some important theory that participate. 
<br/></p>
<h3><b>[1]The theory of the Power generation principle</b></h3>
<p >Before we realize the principle of wind turbine generator, let us see some background. If classifying the wind turbines from spindle direction, we can classify them into the horizontal spindle wind turbines and vertical spindle wind turbines. For wind power generator with horizontal spindle wind turbine, we 
usually use the control system to keep the wind spindle in the windward state, making sure that the rotor rotates successfully.</p>

<p >The principle of wind turbine generator is to convert wind energy into mechanical energy and then into electrical energy. The wind flows through the blades at a certain speed and angle, making the wind wheel obtain the moment, which means the force makes the object rotate around the rotation axis. The rotor (composed of blades and turbine) usually has a large quantity - a single blade of a large wind turbine weighs several tons, so considering its inertia, the design speed of the wind wheel is low, usually 20~30r/min. Then, the lower speed input by the wind turbine is increased to 1000~1500 r/min through the speed increase gearbox. In this way, with the increase of the rotation speed of the rotor inside the generator, its cutting speed of the magnetic field can meet the power generation needs of the generator. People always believe that the bigger power the generation makes, the better it is. However, this thought is a wrong, because the wind power generator is only a device used to charging the battery, and the power is determined by the battery. The miniature wind turbine generator is suitable for use in some areas. In mountain areas, Wind power generation system can be used for street lights, road signs on expressways, and so on.[2]The secret of the gear ratio
Gear transmission system is one of an important parts of wind turbine generator model. Under normal conditions, the wind turbine rotates very slowly,which far below the speed required by the generator for power generation. According to the analysis of physical theory, when two gears with different radii mesh and rotate, their linear speeds are the same, so the gear with smaller radius has larger angular speed and faster speed. Therefore, by using gear set transmission, the lower wind turbine speed can be changed into a higher generator speed, thus the wind turbine can generate electricity even in a small wind speed. When installing gears, there are three gear ratios: 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1 for us to choose. To verify the above analysis,

<h3>[2]The secret of the gear ratio</h3>
<p >Gear transmission system is one of an important parts of wind turbine generator model. Under normal conditions, the wind turbine rotates very slowly,which far below the speed required by the generator for power generation. According to the analysis of physical theory, when two gears with different radii mesh and rotate, their linear speeds are the same, so the gear with smaller radius has larger angular speed and faster speed. Therefore, by using gear set transmission, the lower wind turbine speed can be changed into a higher generator speed, thus the wind turbine can generate electricity even in a small wind speed. When installing gears, there are three gear ratios: 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1 for us to choose. To verify the above analysis, we use different gear sets for transmission and measure the generator output voltage respectively. We found that when the gear ratio is 8:1, the generator output voltage is the maximum, and when the gear ratio is 2:1, the generator output voltage is the minimum.And when the gear ratio is 4:1, the output voltage of the generator is between the two. According to the above theory and experimental results, we choose 8:1 gear ratio for transmission. In addition, we once considered using three gears for transmission. However, the experiment found that it could not change the gear ratio, and would increase the friction consumption between gears and reduce the power generation efficiency of the generator, so it was not adopted in the end.Moreover,when installing the gear, the position of the generator should be flexibly adjusted according to the size of the gear to 
    ensure that the two gears mesh normally and reduce friction loss.</p>
<h2><div style="letter-spacing:10px;">Methodology - Equipment and procedure</div></h2>
<p >When we were testing the power of the wind turbine, we took three variables into account, they were the shape of the blade, the distance to the fan, and the speed of the wind. Obviously they were affecting the result to some extent. Therefore, we controlled the variables to see which variable contributed most to the result and to find the best choice of each pair of variable. Our findings are as follow.
</p>
<img class="turbine" src="https://ts1.cn.mm.bing.net/th/id/R-C.d098fd34639a84d035f50a78312308e2?rik=HDigZ5P6qIS%2b%2bQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.1cae.com%2fi%2fg%2fac%2facdb559f5c87a5aecd6084edae865a74r.jpg&ehk=%2f3T2D1m1lJbYBEGwgE93IZlKK20TdGuzMHCYpqK%2fIX8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0&sres=1&sresct=1" width ="640"heigh="454">
<p>Firstly, we take the shape of the blade into consideration, since different shapes will contribute a lot to the result of the output of the power. We made the blades in the shape of streamline, because we thought most wings of airplanes were in this shape, which could make airplanes fly faster. However, the result was out of our expectations—the blades hardly spun, and the voltage and the current were very low, thus, the output of the power was merely 0.00015W. Therefore, we change our thoughts and made some blades in the shape of diamond. We believed the shape of diamond could make use of the wind to the most extent. By comparison, when the blades were in the shape of diamond, the output of power was 0.383W, much higher than the previous data. So in the next stages we used the blades in the shape of diamond.</p>

Then we change the distance, we guess that when we reduce the distance ,the output of the wind turbine will be increasing, but in fact not ,we got the number of voltage is0.35V,and the current is 0.003A, not a good numerical value. after trying and trying we find that at a specific distance ,maybe 50cm ,the turbine goes the fastest.it turns out that the direction of the wind plays an important role, when the distance was too small, the wind gives out a vertical force to block the blade, so we need to find the best, through testing and testing ,we find the most suitab
</p>
<p>At last, we turned the second shift, as we speculate, when the speed of wind was higher, our turbine would produce more energy . much to our surprise ,the power of the turbine was not proportional to the square of the wind speed, e.g, the first shift was 5m/s and the second shift was 6m/s, but the power provided formal: the latter was not 25:36, to this condition, I thought air friction affecting it, After all, real life was less ideal than theory, and there were always environmental affections to produce errors. We thought next time we need to take these factors into consideration.
    In conclusion, through hard work and repeated experiments, we finally found the most suitable composition of blades, the distance to the fan, and the speed of the wind after trials and errors.  After all, we observed other group’s work, from which we found ourselves a lot of errors. For example , we need to measure a group of value number to decrease the error. We need to stay away from the fans to avoid affecting the wind ,we are ought to take more factors into our plan. I believe that next time ,we will give out a much more excellent essay.</p>
<h2><div style="letter-spacing:10px;">Overall conclusion</div></h2>
<p main>it is  a surprise  for us to find some datums. However, in this experiment and manufacture we obtain not only the knowledge but also it opens the doors to explore the mechanical engineering, which is make our world develop sustainably and scientifically .Just like UN Environment Commission said ,’Developments that meet the needs of the present without compromising  the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.’ We should inject lasting impetus into development of engineering.</p>
